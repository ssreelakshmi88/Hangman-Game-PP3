# Hangman
“Hangman” is a classic word game. The concept is to guess the correct word with minimum attempts possible. The user will be penalized for each incorrect guess by the appearance of apparatus for hanging in a step-by-step fashion finally culminating with the appearance of a hanging man. I have developed this game based on computer word list. This game has been developed with Python.

## Testing

For this project I have done the following tests:

- Passed the code through a PEP8 liner and confirmed there are no errors.

- Using directional key inputs'.

- Tested in my local terminal and Code Institute Heroku terminal


#### Validator testing

- PEP8 No errors were found in PEP8online.com

### Deployment

This project was deployed using Code Insitute's mock terminal for Heroku.

#### Steps for deployment

1. Fork or clone the repository.

2. Create a new Heroku app.

3. Set the buildbacks to Python and NodeJS in that order.

4. Link the Heroku app to the repository.

5. Click on Deploy
